# YaST - The Control File Schema Definition #

## Notes

Distribute also the generated control.rng file, the reason is that "trang"
is a Java tool which adds huge dependency in OBS.

The conversion needs to be done manually (by running "rake generate_rng")
and the converted RNG file must be committed to Git.

At build time the RNG file from tarball will have a newer time stamp
and thus it will not need rebuild/update making "trang" unnecessary.

See also the [documentation for the control file][doc].
